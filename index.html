      Our campaign involves spreading awareness of the RIPB feedback form. Thus, we will advocate for its frequent use, helping to improve the communication between the student body and RIPB. We do this by working hand in hand with the rest of the RIPB and the students to get a consensus on how we should push for more feedback. With this preliminary round of opinions, we can work to keep on improving more and more aspects of the school together.

      <div class = 'header'>Why You Should Vote For Us</div>
      You should totally give us your vote because we'll work towards bridging the RIPB and general student body so as to improve the communication between the two entities. This way, we and the RIPB will be better able to serve you and the school by bringing you fun and interesting initiatives that you actually asked for. Furthermore, we're also approachable people whom you can talk to, be it regarding school work or your personal life. Lastly, if you give us your vote, we'll definitely put in our 110% into serving the RIPB, and thus our 110% into serving you.
