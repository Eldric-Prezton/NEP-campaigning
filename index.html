      Our campaign involves spreading awareness of the RIPB feedback form. Thus, we will advocate for its frequent use, helping to improve the communication between the student body and RIPB. We do this by working hand in hand with the rest of the RIPB and the students to get a consensus on how we should push for more feedback. With this preliminary round of opinions, we can work to keep on improving more and more aspects of the school together.

    <div id = 'whyvote'>
      <p class = 'header'>Why You Should Vote For Us</p>
      You should totally give us your vote because we'll work towards bridging the RIPB and general student body so as to improve the communication between the two entities. This way, we and the RIPB will be better able to serve you and the school by bringing you fun and interesting initiatives that you actually asked for. Furthermore, we're also approachable people whom you can talk to, be it regarding school work or your personal life. Lastly, if you give us your vote, we'll definitely put in our 110% into serving the RIPB, and thus our 110% into serving you.

          I have many initiatives that I would like to execute when I become prefect. Firstly, I want to push out the power bank initiative. Are there times in which you forget to charge your iPad, and cannot access the notes that your teacher pushed out to you? Fret not! If I am elected as prefect, I would ensure that every class has a power bank available in class, readily available. Also, a system would be put in place by recording the person in which the power bank is loaned out to so as to account for any damage, also doubling up as a way to track down recalcitrates.
      <p>
          Secondly, I would like to be the bridge between the RIPB and the student body. Do you feel that information from the RIPB and some initiatives that are carried out are not very appealing to you? If so, then vote for me. I gather the general feedback of the entire school, from Y1 to Y4, to see what types of activities appeal to you. From better Esports competitions on the individual scale to interclass competitions. All of these activities would allow for you to be more bonded to you class.  to readily available surveys would be put in place for the student body to provide feedback easily.
